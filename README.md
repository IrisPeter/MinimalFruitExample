# MinimalFruitExample
Repository to Share Code for learning Google Fruit Dependency Injection Library

Very unexciting repository, any objects added won't actually do anything useful just be creatable and show some aspect of Google fruit that might not be included amongst the demonstrations within the actual Google Fruit repository - https://github.com/google/fruit/tree/master/examples

Once the correct code is submitted they will only be guaranteed to build with the 3.6.0 release of Google Fruit
